                        <p>
                            1. Welcome to BritFly! Please read our policy carefully. We don’t guarantee that applying through BritFly will ensure a visa, but we do guarantee that our total processing time is six months. Within this period, you might receive a work permit or a visa, but there’s no guarantee. Remember, the embassy issues the visa, and the work permit depends on the company. If you get your work permit within six months, you can apply for the visa. </p>
                        <p>
                            2. If we fail to provide the work permit within six months, you will receive a 100% security deposit refund. You are eligible to withdraw your application after this period, but withdrawing before six months or during the process will result in the loss of your security deposit. However, if you choose to withdraw after six months and BritFly has not provided the work permit, you will receive a full refund. Alternatively, you may grant us a three-month extension, based on your preference.
                        </p>
